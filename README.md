# Learning SvelteKit

Following along with Joy of Code's Full Stack SvelteKit for Beginners
- [Blog post](https://joyofcode.xyz/sveltekit-for-beginners)
- [YouTube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLA9WiRZ-IS_zXZZyW4qfj0akvOAtk6MFS)

The tutorial was designed for pre-release candidate SvelteKit (which came with several breaking changes), so I will constantly reference [SvelteKit documentation](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/introduction) where appropriate.
